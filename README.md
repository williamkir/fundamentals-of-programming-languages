Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of various projects completed during the course, including individual assignments and group projects.

**About the Course**

Programming fundamentals lay the groundwork for constructing software applications. These essential building blocks encompass syntax, the grammar of a programming language, and semantics, the meaning behind the code. Understanding data types, such as integers, floats, and strings, is crucial for representing different kinds of information. Variables serve as containers for storing data, allowing for dynamic manipulation. Control flow structures, including conditional statements and loops, dictate the program's execution path based on specific conditions. Functions modularize code, promoting reusability and code organization. Input and output operations facilitate communication between the program and the user or external systems. By mastering these core concepts, programmers can effectively design, implement, and maintain software solutions.

Individual projects

**Project 1: Area of shapes**

This code is a basic area calculator. It defines functions to calculate the areas of triangles, circles, and squares. The program presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose the desired shape. Once a shape is selected, the program prompts for necessary dimensions (base and height for triangles, radius for circles, and length for squares), calculates the area using the appropriate formula, and displays the result. The process repeats until the user chooses to exit.



**Project 2: Grade system**

This code implements a simple grade system that converts numerical scores into letter grades. It defines grade boundaries and their corresponding letter grades, allowing users to input scores and receive immediate grading feedback. The system ensures input validity and provides continuous execution until the user chooses to exit.




**Project 3: Onepage Website**

This code is a single HTML document that presents all its content on a single, vertically scrolling page. Unlike traditional multi-page websites, it doesn't require users to navigate through multiple pages to access information.
Instead, content is divided into sections or modules that are revealed as the user scrolls down.




**Project 4: Login Interface**

This code is the programming logic that creates and manages the visual elements and functionalities associated with a user logging into a system. It typically involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and backend languages like Python, Java, or Node.js for server-side processing.
