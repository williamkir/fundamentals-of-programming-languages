Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of various projects completed during the course, including individual assignments and group projects.

**About the Course**

Programming fundamentals lay the groundwork for constructing software applications. These essential building blocks encompass syntax, the grammar of a programming language, and semantics, the meaning behind the code. Understanding data types, such as integers, floats, and strings, is crucial for representing different kinds of information. Variables serve as containers for storing data, allowing for dynamic manipulation. Control flow structures, including conditional statements and loops, dictate the program's execution path based on specific conditions. Functions modularize code, promoting reusability and code organization. Input and output operations facilitate communication between the program and the user or external systems. By mastering these core concepts, programmers can effectively design, implement, and maintain software solutions.

Individual projects

**Project 1: **



**Project 2: Grade system**

This code implements a simple grade system that converts numerical scores into letter grades. It defines grade boundaries and their corresponding letter grades, allowing users to input scores and receive immediate grading feedback. The system ensures input validity and provides continuous execution until the user chooses to exit.
